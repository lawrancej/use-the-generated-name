= Dictorobitary

Dictorobitary is a parsing library that:

* accepts all context-free grammars
* operates at high speed
* uses a EBNF specification both as a DSEL and as a string
* sips memory
* chooses the appropriate parsing algorithm based on the grammar
* is non-blocking
* is unicode-capable
* will not leak memory
* is easy to embed in your code
* is easy to extend in your code

In short, Dictorobitary is the language computer: a machine that translates any language into our own.
